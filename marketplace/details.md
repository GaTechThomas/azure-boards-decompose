# Easy decomposition of work items #

**Decompose** allows you to quickly break down work items into sub-hierarchies. 

- Quickly create hierarchies of work items
- Should it be a Task or is it big enough for a Story? Promote/Demote work items easily between different hierarchy levels
- Full support for keyboard shortcuts. Just like your favorite editor (VS Code), you never have to leave the keyboard
- Iterate on descriptions before commiting

## Example: Starting a Sprint ##
When you start to work on a feature and you want to quickly break it down into User Stories and Tasks you can use Excel, manually create work items, or the *New Item* panel on the Backlog. This all works, but isn't as convenient as it could be. 

With **Decompose** you can easily define hierarchies, change work items between levels, and finally create actual work items with a single click.
